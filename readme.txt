The WooCommerce Subscription Date Based Downloads make downloadable files in subscription products available for months that your subscribers paid.

== Description ==
Make downloadable files in subscription products available for months that your subscribers paid. 

The extension modifies the downloads filter and bypasses the subscription status. If a subscriber's account was suspended after 2 months, they won't have access to the files added for month 3, but they will continue to have access to month 1 & 2. If they pay in month 4, they have access to month 1, 2 & 4. 

They can go back and pay the pending renewal order in Month 3 at any time to gain access to those files. You can set the month that a file is associated with via a calendar and change them whenever you want. Perfect for magazine type subscriptions services, or any subscription site that releases content monthly.
